## What is this?
A dumb, simple PlayCover-compatible decryption server for app packages

## How do I use this?
1. Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install additional dependencies: 
- ideviceinstaller

If you are prompted to log in, `runtime/tools/ipatools auth` shall do the trick
